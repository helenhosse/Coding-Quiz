# Coding-Quiz

## USER Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Description

In this challenge, I have made a quiz that contains 5 multiple choice questions that is timed for up to 75 seconds. There will be 4 options, and only one answer will be correct. For each question that the user misses, 10 seconds will be deducted from the total time that is left. The quiz will end from either all 5 questions being answered or the time runs out. Once the game is over, the user will be directed to a page to add their initials and can view the latest high scores.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over

## Installation

I have provided 2 links at the end of this page that should be able to work on any device.
